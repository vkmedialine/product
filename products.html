                <h3>Desktop Computer</h3>
                    <p>A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a single location, typically a desk or table. It consists of separate components such as a central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (such as hard drives or solid-state drives), a motherboard, graphics processing unit (GPU), power supply, and various input/output peripherals like a keyboard and mouse.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike portable computers like laptops or tablets, desktop computers are stationary and are not designed for easy mobility. They often provide more powerful hardware configurations compared to their portable counterparts, making them suitable for demanding tasks such as gaming, content creation, and other resource-intensive applications.<br>
                    <br>
                    Desktop computers come in various form factors, including tower, mini-tower, small form factor (SFF), and all-in-one (AIO) designs. The tower form factor typically has a separate monitor, while all-in-one systems integrate the computer components into the monitor itself, reducing the overall footprint. Desktop computers are versatile and can be customized and upgraded with additional hardware components to meet specific user needs and preferences.</p>

                <h3>Laptop</h3>
                <p>A laptop, short for "laptop computer," is a portable personal computer designed for mobile use. It is smaller and more compact than desktop computers, featuring an integrated screen, keyboard, and pointing device (usually a touchpad or trackpad). Laptops are designed to be carried easily and are suitable for use in various locations, making them convenient for users who need computing capabilities on the go.<br>
                <br>
                Key features of a laptop include:
                <br><br>
                1. <b>Portability:</b> Laptops are designed to be lightweight and compact, allowing users to carry them easily in backpacks or briefcases.
                <br><br>
                2. <b>Integrated Components:</b> Laptops have a built-in display, keyboard, and pointing device, eliminating the need for external peripherals. Many modern laptops also include built-in webcams, speakers, and microphones.
                <br><br>
                3. <b>Battery Power:</b> Laptops have a built-in rechargeable battery, enabling them to operate without being connected to a power source for a certain period. This makes them suitable for use in locations where power outlets may be unavailable or inconvenient.
                <br><br>
                4. <b>Foldable Design:</b> Laptops typically have a hinge mechanism that allows them to be opened and closed like a clamshell. This design protects the screen and keyboard when the laptop is not in use and provides a compact form factor for easy transport.
                <br><br>
                5. <b>Versatility:</b> Laptops are capable of running a wide range of applications and can handle various computing tasks, making them suitable for work, entertainment, and communication purposes.
                <br><br>
                While laptops offer portability and convenience, they may have limitations in terms of upgradeability and performance compared to desktop computers. Advances in technology, however, have led to the development of powerful laptops that can rival some desktop systems in terms of performance.</p>

              <div class="text">
                <h3>Printer</h3>
                <p>A printer is a peripheral device that produces a hard copy (physical representation) of electronic or digital documents, images, or other visual information stored on a computer or other digital device. Printers are commonly used in offices and homes to create tangible copies of documents, photos, graphics, and more.
                <br><br>
                There are several types of printers, each with its own technology and functionality. The main types include:
                <br><br>
                1. <b>Inkjet Printers:</b> These printers use liquid ink to produce high-quality prints. They are commonly used for printing documents and high-resolution photos.
                <br><br>
                2. <b>Laser Printers:</b> Laser printers use toner powder and a laser beam to create prints. They are known for their fast printing speeds and are often used in office environments for text-heavy documents.
                <br><br>
                3. <b>Dot Matrix Printers:</b> These printers use a matrix of small pins to strike an ink ribbon, transferring characters or images onto paper. They are less common today but were widely used in the past for multipart forms.
                <br><br>
                4. <b>Dye-Sublimation Printers:</b> This type of printer uses heat to transfer dye onto various materials, including paper, plastic, or fabric. They are commonly used for high-quality photo printing.
                <br><br>
                5. <b>3D Printers:</b> Unlike traditional printers that produce flat images on paper, 3D printers create three-dimensional objects layer by layer. They are used in various industries for prototyping, manufacturing, and even in hobbyist settings.
                <br><br>
                Printers are connected to computers or networks either through wired (such as USB or Ethernet) or wireless (such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) connections. They play a crucial role in creating physical copies of digital content for a wide range of applications, from everyday documents to professional-quality photos and designs.</p>

                <h3>All in one PC</h3>
                <p>An All-in-One (AIO) PC, short for "All-in-One Personal Computer," is a desktop computer system that integrates the major components, including the display, within a single unit. Unlike traditional desktop computers that consist of separate components like a tower, monitor, and peripherals, an All-in-One PC combines these elements into a compact and space-saving design.
                <br><br>
                Key features of All-in-One PCs include:
                <br><br>
                1. <b>Integrated Design:</b> The AIO PC integrates the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and often the graphics processing unit (GPU) into the monitor housing. This design eliminates the need for a separate tower or chassis, resulting in a streamlined and aesthetically pleasing appearance.
                <br><br>
                2. <b>Space Efficiency:</b> All-in-One PCs are known for their space-saving design, making them ideal for environments where space is limited. Since all the components are housed in the monitor, there are no additional peripherals cluttering the workspace.
                <br><br>
                3. <b>Single Power Cord:</b> All-in-One PCs typically require only a single power cord, simplifying cable management compared to traditional desktop setups.
                <br><br>
                4. <b>Touchscreen Option:</b> Many All-in-One PCs come with a touchscreen display, allowing users to interact with the computer using touch gestures in addition to the traditional keyboard and mouse.
                <br><br>
                5. <b>Versatility:</b> While All-in-One PCs are commonly used for general computing tasks, they are available in various configurations, including models suitable for gaming or professional content creation.
                <br><br>
                These computers are often favored for their sleek design and simplicity, making them suitable for home users, businesses, and educational institutions. They offer a convenient and space-efficient solution for individuals who want a desktop computer without the complexity of a traditional desktop setup.</p>
